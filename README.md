## Breakdown
1. Takes user input
2. Checks that user input for non-Numbers
3. If tests passed runs the program
4. Clears the previous output in order to start afresh.
5. Loops through numbers from 1 to the user input number.
6. Checks if number is a multiple of three using the modulus
7. If a multiple of 3, checks if the number is also a multiple of five in order to print ping-pong. if a multiple of 3 only prints ping.
8. code then checks if the number i a multiple of 5 to print pong.
9. If the number is not a multiple of the above it prints the number.
